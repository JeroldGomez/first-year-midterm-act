            What I love most about being a programmer is the invigorating feeling you get every time you get a little deeper into the rabbit hole, it makes me want to keep going and going. 
            One problem that I have noticed with learning on my own is that you can't make connections as easily with professionals in the field, 
            and I feel like there is no better way to learn than by interacting with someone who knows what they're doing. 
            It seems like lately programming has been in the spotlight more and more, 
            it has become more mainstream which means more people are being exposed to JavaScript and front end development, its popularity can only be good for the future of JavaScript. 
            I have been involved in multiple projects since high school as well as freelancing for friends doing a bit of full stack development as well as front end.
